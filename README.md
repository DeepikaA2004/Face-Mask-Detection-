# Face Mask Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting the presence of face masks on individuals using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of images containing people with and without masks, and it is designed to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

## Model Details

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Trained for 48 epochs.
- Training Data Accuracy: 93%
- Test Data Accuracy: 92%

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for face mask detection.
